// MARK: - StockSage data models
//
// Integrated from the StockSage v32 package, but reworked as plain value types
// instead of the package's SwiftData `@Model` classes. Reasons:
//   * The package's `MarketStore` did `try! ModelContainer(for: MarketSymbol.self,
//     Quote.self)` in its initializer — a force-try that crashes the whole app if
//     the container can't be built. Value types in an in-memory store can't crash
//     on init.
//   * The `MarketSymbol` / `Quote` SwiftData models were *referenced* by the
//     package but never *included* in it, so it couldn't compile.
//   * `StockSage`-prefixed names avoid colliding with Chat A's existing
//     `MarketStore` (`Views/MarketsStub.swift`).
//
// These are the minimal shapes the signal engine, briefing service, and monitor
// actually read. When Chat A's live Yahoo feed lands, it just produces these.

/// One price observation for a symbol.
struct StockSageQuote: Sendable, Equatable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID

    /// The immediately-prior price, used by the signal engine to compute change.
